Coursera - Final course project - Getting and Cleaning Data #3

This is the final course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera.

Please, check the run_analysis.R script that conduct the following steps:

1. Download data sets from the web and merge them (training and test sets) to create one and only data set.

2. Merge all the data sets (train and test sets) into a setAllInOne data set (dim = 10299 563)
I also assign names for variables. (step 4)

3. Extract measurements on the mean and std deviation

4. Use descriptive activity names and labels to make the data more understandable
See previous steps

5. Create a tidy data set that is the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity ("secTidySet").
